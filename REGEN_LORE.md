# RegenTrail - Real World Regenerative Lore

## Overview
RegenTrail has been updated with real-world regenerative events, projects, and movements from 2024. The game now serves as both an entertaining clicker game and an educational journey through the actual ReFi (Regenerative Finance) ecosystem.

## The GreenPill Movement

### Background
The game is inspired by **Kevin Owocki's GreenPill movement** - a philosophy that uses Web3 technology to create regenerative cryptoeconomic systems. The core principle is that blockchain and cryptoeconomics can be used to create positive externalities for the world, moving beyond extractive economies to regenerative ones.

### Key Concepts
- **Regenerative Cryptoeconomics**: Economic systems that satisfy human needs while creating positive externalities
- **Public Goods Funding**: Using quadratic funding and other mechanisms to democratically fund public goods
- **ImpactDAOs**: Decentralized organizations creating positive impact for the world
- **Solarpunk Future**: An optimistic vision of the future where humans thrive alongside nature
